Personal Use Japanese Study Tool. Kana, Kanji, Romaji. Work in Progress

As stated above, this is a work in progress.
I began studying Japanese and created this tool to help me with the Kanji I have learned.

This program reads from a file that has all the vocabulary and parses through it
to have each individual word with all its' associated content.
